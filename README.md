JavaScript Code of Streak - Day16 

Q)Write a JavaScript program to check two given integers have opposite signs or not.

Test Data:
(100, -100) -> "Signs are opposite"
(100, 100) -> "Signs are not opposite"
(â€˜100, 100) -> "Parameters value must be number!"

Sample Output:

Signs are opposite           
Signs are not opposite      
Parameters value must be number!             

Explanation:

Basically in this program, two values are assigned by the user and it is verified whether the values are of the same sign, oppostie sign or their parameters are different.
If the assigned values are of different sign(means one is positive and one negative), then "Signs are oppostie" is displayed to the user.
If the values are of same sign, "Signs are not opposite" is displayed. And if the parameter(data type) of one of the values is different, then "Parameters value must be
same" will be displayed.
